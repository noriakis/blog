  abstract = "Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients has a
              significant bearing on outcome, in terms of both morbidity and
              mortality. However, there are few national assessments of
              diabetes care during hospitalization which could serve as a
              baseline for change. This analysis of a large clinical database
              (74 million unique encounters corresponding to 17 million unique
              patients) was undertaken to provide such an assessment and to
              find future directions which might lead to improvements in
              patient safety. Almost 70,000 inpatient diabetes encounters were
              identified with sufficient detail for analysis. Multivariable
              logistic regression was used to fit the relationship between the
              measurement of HbA1c and early readmission while controlling for
              covariates such as demographics, severity and type of the
              disease, and type of admission. Results show that the measurement
              of HbA1c was performed infrequently (18.4\%) in the inpatient
              setting. The statistical model suggests that the relationship
              between the probability of readmission and the HbA1c measurement
              depends on the primary diagnosis. The data suggest further that
              the greater attention to diabetes reflected in HbA1c
              determination may improve patient outcomes and lower cost of
              inpatient care.",
